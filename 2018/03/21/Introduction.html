<font size="5" color="#000000">Mirage is a tool desiged to run alongside a game or program and synchronize screenshots between you and your friends.
	The initial idea came to me when I got annoyed over the constant chatter regarding loot while playing PUBG and that's why I'm using it as a test case.
	All users connect to a host before the game starts and Mirage then automates screenshot sharing every time a player opens his or her inventory. This way all players can see a somewhat up to date version of the other player's inventories and therefore VOIP can be used for more meaningful communication.<br /><br /></font>

<font size="6" color="#000000">This is what Mirage currently looks like.<br /></font>
<font size="5" color="#000000">It's in Alpha right now and the only supported game is PUBG as I'm using that as a test case. For beta I will however implement a system that allows users (Like you! :D) to create their own setups that works for other games and programs.</font>
