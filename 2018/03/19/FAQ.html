<font size="6" color="#000000">Does Mirage only work for PUBG?</font>
<p>Currenty Yes.<br />
This is because I use PUBG as a test app. Once Mirage enters beta it will be possible to configure it to use any clipping/position rectangles so that it can be used as a generic clipped screenshot sharing program.</p>

<font size="6" color="#000000">Will Mirage affect my performance ingame?</font>
<p>Most likely not.<br />
Mirage only uses a little bit of CPU and memory while processing an image. It does however currently consume a significant amount of bandwidth.</p>

<font size="6" color="#000000">Why does my antivirus warn me about Mirage?</font>
<p>False positive heuristics hit.<br />
Many third party anti virus programs (AVG, Avast, etc) use heuristics (algorithmic guesswork) to identify unknown programs that behave suspiciously. For Mirage; they detect that it is taking background input and also opening network sockets and likely (falsely) flags it as a keylogger.</p>

<font size="6" color="#000000">Why does BattlEye not let me start the game while Mirage is running?</font>
<p>Anti virus has falsely flagged it as malicious.<br />
Battleye does not allow suspected malicious programs to run alongside the game.</p>

<font size="6" color="#000000">All my screenshots are black/old; why?</font>
<p>You are running the game in fullscreen.<br />
Games running in fullscreen cannot be captured via the OS interface. I will try to implement support for fullscreen applications after 1.0 but this requires som hacking that anti cheat engines (like BattlEye doesnâ€™t like).</p>
