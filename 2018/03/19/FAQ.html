<font size="6" color="#000000">Does Mirage only work for PUBG?</font>
<p>Currenty Yes.<br />
This is because I use PUBG as a test app. Once Mirage enters beta it will be possible to configure it to use any clipping/position rectangles so that it can be used as a generic clipped screenshot sharing program.</p>

<font size="6" color="#000000">Will Mirage affect my performance ingame?</font>
<p>Most likely not.<br />
Mirage only uses a little bit of CPU and memory while processing an image. It does however currently consume a significant amount of bandwidth.</p>

<font size="6" color="#000000">Why does my antivirus warn me about Mirage?</font>
<p>False positive heuristics hit.<br />
Many third party anti virus programs (AVG, Avast, etc) use heuristics (algorithmic guesswork) to identify unknown programs that behave suspiciously. For Mirage; they detect that it is taking background input and also opening network sockets and likely (falsely) flags it as a keylogger.</p>

<font size="6" color="#000000">Why does BattlEye not let me start the game while Mirage is running?</font>
<p>Anti virus has falsely flagged it as malicious.<br />
Battleye does not allow suspected malicious programs to run alongside the game.</p>

<font size="6" color="#000000">All my screenshots are black/old; why?</font>
<p>You are running the game in fullscreen.<br />
Games running in fullscreen cannot be captured via the OS interface. I will try to implement support for fullscreen applications after 1.0 but this requires som hacking that anti cheat engines (like BattlEye) probably approve of.</p>

<font size="6" color="#000000">Does Mirage collect and store any of my information?</font>
<p>No.<br />
Mirage only stores the config and log files and the data is not sent to any centralized server.</p>

<font size="6" color="#000000">Why isn't Mirage open source?</font>
<p>For your safety.<br />
Since Mirage has issues with anti virus program heuristics; many users will likely just dismiss the warnings. If someone were to make a fake version of Mirage that is actually malicious and distribute it; user would likely just dismiss the warnings for that version as well and POOF!

Try to give as precise information as possible about what you were doing up until the point where the bug occured.<br />
It would be super cool if you could write actual reproduction steps :)</p>
